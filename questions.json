    "question": "What are the key reasons why individual actions alone may not significantly impact climate change, according to the article?",
    "answer": "The article argues that individual actions, such as recycling or reducing light usage, may give a false sense of progress because systemic problems require systemic solutions.

Additionally, it highlights the need for incentives that align individual interests with collective environmental goals, as many individual choices can actually be counterproductive to broader efforts."

    "question": "What are the main challenges in changing a complex system, according to the article?",
    "answer": "The article outlines several challenges in changing a complex system: 1. Need for a Theory: Effective intervention requires a solid theoretical understanding of the system, as unintended side effects may occur due to the unpredictable nature of complex systems. 2. Focus on Incentives: It's crucial to focus on altering incentives rather than blaming individuals or the system itself, as many participants are just responding to existing structures. 3. Incremental Change: Effective change often requires incremental adjustments, starting from the highest-leverage points within the system, and making small, manageable changes rather than attempting a complete overhaul. 4. Complex Interdependencies: The interconnectedness of system components can lead to unexpected consequences from seemingly small changes, emphasizing the need for careful analysis and data gathering before making decisions. 5. Resistance to Change: Many systems are entrenched, making it difficult for any single actor to implement change, particularly when collective action is needed to address systemic failures."
